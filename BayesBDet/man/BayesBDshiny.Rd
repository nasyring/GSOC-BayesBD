\title{
Boundary detection and shiny integration
}
\description{
This function produces a local shiny instance for easily producing graphics of boundary detection simulations and real-data analyses.  There is example data and an example function in the "data" and "scripts" folders.  The example data shows how to format image boundary data in a file and was generated using Gaussian intensities and an ellipse boundary.  The example boundary function in the "scripts" folder is a simple function producing a circle boundary.
